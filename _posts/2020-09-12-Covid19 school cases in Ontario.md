Deprecating the various charts below.

~~I've created a visualization of Covid-19 school cases in Ontario. There are three different visualizations.~~
1. ~~Municipality schools with Covid-19 cases in Ontario~~
2. ~~Staff and student related Covid-19 cases in Ontario~~
3. ~~Location map of Covid-19 School cases in Ontario~~

The source data is from the [Ontario Government Data](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario).
