I've created a visualization of Covid-19 school cases in Ontario. There are three different visualizations.
1. [Municipality schools with Covid-19 cases in Ontario](\files\municipality_school_with_active_cases_ontario.html) 
2. [Staff and student related Covid-19 cases in Ontario](\files\school_related_cases_ontario.html)
3. [Location map of Covid-19 School cases in Ontario](\files\covid_cases_school_map.html)

The source data is from the [Ontario Government Data](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario).
