I've created a visualization of Covid-19 school cases in Ontario. There are two different visualizations.
1. [Covid-19 School cases in Ontario](\files\school_cases_ontario.html) 
2. [Covid-19 School related cases in Ontario](\files\school__related_cases_ontario.html)

The source data is from the [Ontario Government Data](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario).
